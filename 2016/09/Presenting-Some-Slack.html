    <p>Today on September 29th, my team and I gave a presentation of a software tool known as Slack. Slack is a platform over which teams can communicate and collaborate in order to advance their work and projects. Originally intended for more technically-oriented areas, Slack allows one to share code and supports numerous integrations with other very popular software. Thus, our presentation thereof was an interesting experience as, despite our being Computer Science majors, our own experience with Slack had been fairly limited. Of our five members, one had used it briefly for a class, another had only heard of it, and in my case, I had only used it formerly for one club. We quickly picked up the slack before presenting.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the nature of the platform allowed for a quick study. We used slack as one would to help collaborate over any other project, but this time to learn about Slack itself. This in particular is not a novel concept, as previous generations of software have become so depended upon in other teams’ workflows. For example, vice president of facilities and development at University of Florida Health, Brad Pollitt, put all his team members aboard the platform Everything DiSC, and after completion, those initially reluctant members eagerly brought the software to their own teams (Armstrong Welch, 2016). In our presentation, we hoped to do the same by eagerly presenting our personal experience and understanding of Slack.</p>

<p>This style of presentation I found particularly fitting, as it occurred immediately after another (I might add, excellent) presentation of how Slack works for teams in theory. Before beginning, I asked the current project manager (as we follow Agile methodology) if he would like to present first, but having declined, I jumped into it. In particular, after introductions, I presented the basic interface as well as the channel structure. Thenceforth, the team switched off in explaining various aspects of Slack, such as snippets, emojis, and integrations. Near the end of the excursion, however, I grew concerned as I felt that our team lacked something that connected us with the audience.</p>

<p>After my team member had concluded his explanation, I decided to speak once more. I followed a few presentation strategies (subconsciously) which come recommended by author Cavicchia Marilyn: connect with individuals, introduce some surprise, and tell a story (2015). I explained that we were using Slack for the class’s project, and I asked the audience directly if they had noticed something odd about our integrations channel. Thence, I redoubled with both surprise and the opportunity to re-explain the channel; I showed how Slack allows one to subscribe to RSS feeds by showing recent postings from a popular Irish news website (though completely irrelevant to the project). Finally, I ended with a story by explaining how I pinned a message from the former team’s project manager. To my relief, the audience gave us a good applause.</p>
