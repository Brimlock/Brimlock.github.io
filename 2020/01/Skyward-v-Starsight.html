    <p>Having gone through both <em><a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/skyward-series/#STARSIGHT">Skyward</a></em> and its sequel, <em><a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/skyward-series/#STARSIGHT">Starsight</a></em>, by Brandon Sanderson, I received two very distinct impressions of the books. On the whole, <em>Skyward</em> was a very good book. It begins as a tale of learning and personal betterment, morphing into a tale of a broken setting, discovery, and achieving against the odds. The end of the book leaves huge questions and massive potential for a sequel. When the sequel did come out, I gave it a try. I did finish it, but not as enthusiastically as the first. For <em>Starsight</em>, I found that the first thirty-one chapters were written for a younger audience, relying on <em>just-in-time</em> moments, tropes, and deus-ex-machina. Chapter thiry-two and after, however, seemes to pick up the original intent and meaning of book one.</p>

<p><em>Warning: Spoilers</em></p>

<p>The first several chapters explain the events of the first book, to an extent that it halts the story. This is understandable given the length of time between the release of the two books, but I believe the author is aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show%2C_don't_tell">show don’t tell</a> philosophy. This part could have been told in ten to fifteen chapters for a much more concise and exciting story. The repetition of themes, unlike in <em>The Stormlight Archive</em> where they function as good examples and reminders, are also quite incessant, such as M-Bot repeating trivial nothings, such as how he is not emotional yet exasperated over human intelligence.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starsight.jpg" alt="Starsight's official cover" text-align="center" /></p>

<p>Additionally, all that was mysterious and exciting in the first book – the ominous aliens, the hope of the outside world, etc – is immediately explained and taken as normal. All that was developed in the first book – almost all characters and setting, are left behind. Thereafter, the whole premise of the book follows a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina">deus ex machina</a> of an unlikely scenario. Using a very soft magic system (or at least, little explained), an alien comes crashing down. This alien happens to have good national relations (former allies) with the humans. The alien happens to have the same power as the main character. She happens to be incapcitated for the rest of the novel, to serve as an excuse for the main character to take her place. On-the-spot, the alien gives the main character the ability to instantly go to the next setting.</p>

<p>Arriving there, there is no bureaucractic problem. She is swept up into pilot training immediately. However, this echo is generally lackluster compared to <em>Skyward</em>. She immediately makes three friends, each very non-convincing (and fsomewhat cringe-worthy) characters. The personalities and demographics are also hard to believe for a military, sci-fi novel. Regardless, they somehow develop deep enough bonds in the matter of days to reconsider their alliegances. The story then drags without reason, explaining some day-to-day events such as alien bathrooms and M-Bot repeating themes. At Chapter twenty-five, Spensa floats in her cockpit and hears her grandmother talk to her literally trillions of miles away using the ever looser magic system. At this point, I was about ready to put the book down. I didn’t see where it was going.</p>

<p>Then came chapter thirty-two. The story immediately gets back on track. Spensa acts more believably (and later her less-than-believable behavior is explained) and M-Bot is mostly left off camera. The most complex, interesting character, Brade, also comes at the forefront. All of Spensa’s interactions with her build intense interest and drama. The drone plan becomes meaningful (instead of M-Bot ranting about AI and having children) and happens at a perfect pace with the rest of the novel. At Spensa’s dead-end, the political twist is revealed, and each character’s purpose is shown. Vapor is the spy, Hesho is the saving-grace ally, Morriumur’s quirk biology becomes extremely relevant, and Brade goes through three-layers of personality and alliegances. When Spensa returns to Detritus, the theme of the futility of war is hammered home.</p>

<p>The end of the novel is… melodramatic. It would be another deus ex, but no character on either side really knows what to expect. Because it’s in the air and the ending scenes are satisfying in any case, I would still say it ended well.</p>

<p>As an aside, there is one point that, unlike most points that are spoon-fed throughout the novel, is never explained explicity. For this reason, I thought it was very well done. The effect of the enemies that can be seen on Spensa only during the second novel suddenly and completely explain the actions of her father (a formerly very important character) in the first novel.</p>
