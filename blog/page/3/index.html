      <p><p>Playing Jack the Giant Killer on the Internet Archive’s Internet Arcade was fascinating. The game immediately stuck out to me because of its classic English setting, with Jack starting mounted to the bottom of the beanstalk. Unlike the various shoot-em’-ups, I was excited with the ability to explore the retro world. I waddled pixel-by-pixel to the ground and walked toward the horizon. When I got to the edge, I died. Wow, okay. With my remaining two lives, I decided to again dismount and head for the house on screen. When I got to the house, I died. On the third life, I ascended the beanstalk. It took me a few seconds to understand what was happening. The back of Jack’s pixelated body was square against the wide, green, globular lines that were the stalk. Against this was an empty, black background.</p>

      <p><p>To be anywhere, doing anything, at any time at all, has long been a dream of total freedom. Now, technology may soon take us there. Within the timeline of technology, there have been many relatively recent, game changing advancements, such as the internet or smartphones. In this case, we are on the verge of a new, almost unpredictable advancement: virtual reality. Virtual reality is the use of a headset to trick the senses into believing a simulation is real. With headsets such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Google Cardboard, and more, an unknown number of real world applications will be pushed.</p>

      <p><p>Within the realm of modern tech, there is one topic which highly concerns all those involved, be they consumers or developers. That is security. Cybersecurity represents the defensive measures employed to deter cyberattacks. This topic is often focused on, with many university courses, open organizations, and private companies. However, in a more clandestine fashion, when parties turn on the offensive, this becomes known as “cyberwarfare,” the subject of Alex Gibney’s film ‘Zero Days.’ Cyberwarfare has changed the scope of war, by becoming a much more accessible form of politics by other means.</p>

      <p><p>Usability testing is a process within developing software solutions, where a sample group of user testers is brought in to interact with the interface of an unfinished product. This allows the software to be tested before release in the most intuitive way: by human end users. However, usability testing has two major shortcomings: repeatability and validity. Repeatability is an issue with user testers, as there are differences between them, which cause variance in results (especially in small sample sizes). Tüzün, Telli, and Alir (2016) note this in particular with gender. Validity questions the test itself; for example, other factors such as screen size may impact a test otherwise intended for graphical user interfaces. (Nielsen, 2000). This usability testing is very important in developing a product. It helps to eliminate bugs, add new features, and make unexpected edits to existing ones. Thus the overall quality of the user interface may be improved. Nielsen (1993) expresses this in two major ways: formative and summative; the former examines individual features of the interface, while the latter gives a holistic view (which may indicate that a different interface be preferred).</p>
