      <p><p>Today on September 29th, my team and I gave a presentation of a software tool known as Slack. Slack is a platform over which teams can communicate and collaborate in order to advance their work and projects. Originally intended for more technically-oriented areas, Slack allows one to share code and supports numerous integrations with other very popular software. Thus, our presentation thereof was an interesting experience as, despite our being Computer Science majors, our own experience with Slack had been fairly limited. Of our five members, one had used it briefly for a class, another had only heard of it, and in my case, I had only used it formerly for one club. We quickly picked up the slack before presenting.</p>

      <p><p>Phone interviews can be a bit intimidating, and potentially awkward, but by no means should that be a roadblock. It is far better to view phone interviews as a quick and easy way to express oneself, as well as avoid the social pressure of appearing visually (for both sides). This is especially useful for interviewees, given that those who are (perhaps unknowingly) less skilled in non-verbal communication are much more rarely called back for a second interview (Levine &amp; Feldman, 2002). After some phone interviews myself near the beginning of my career (as an interviewee), as well as a couple successful ones, I believe I can also give my opinion on the matter.</p>

      <p><p>A fossil I would like to find is one which sheds light on many significant, but still foggy, questions of paleoanthropology. The species it belongs to has received relatively little attention, given its notable lack of findings (but one cranial discovery) (Weiss, 2015). Thus, there must be a post-cranial discovery of Homo rudolfensis, in particular consisting of the humerus and femur. Among the many questions of paleoanthropology this fossil may help to answer, it may solidify the species’s case as having a successful lineage (and perhaps leading even to modern humans). While finding this fossil would be a similar process to its predecessors, the research thereof would be original, and only through understanding this fossil in context may the lineal success of Homo rudolfensis be determined.</p>

      <p><p>Beginning from the ground up, the boot is one article of fashion that has had, and continues to have, a powerful influence on society. This fashion, a traditional part of the military aesthetic, has had an influence on society by way of society’s most explosive and rapidly changing times: the political movement. It is in extreme movements that the influence of the boot may be seen most clearly, such as in Italian fascism, National Socialism, and more recently, the Korean Juche. In particular to the military aesthetic, the fashion of boots, often termed “military,” “combat,” or “tactical,” may influence political movements primarily in two ways: in creating a sense of a unified group identity, and in making a powerful impression of authority.</p>

      <p><p>Progress has had a constant effect in beliefs, practices, technologies, and identities all around the globe. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, its change in identity led people to powerfully align themselves along the relatively new concept of a strong and centralized nation. With this change crept by many innovations, some militaristic and some which were intended for civilian use only. As early as the American Civil War, many of these innovations, as outlined by the Prussian general Erich Ludendorff, set apart this new <em>total</em> war from the limited warfare of old: modern transportation, mass mobilization, propaganda campaigns, wartime economy and legislation, and single authority leadership. Furthermore, this new warfare raged now between nations for total victory or total annihilation, rather than limited warfare’s use only by professional armies as an extension of public policy. The formation of modern nations in the twentieth century, as well as the innovations bespoken by General Ludendorff thenceforth released all belligerent parties from the former constraints of warfare, till the advent of total war and its unprecedented costs.</p>
