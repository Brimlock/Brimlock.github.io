      <p><p>Since my teammate and I first developed the alpha of Parity Peril as a digital game, we added some desired content and critical features. In fact, in the new instructions screen, the story is once again explained to the player. The Kingdom of Odddom has launched an assault on the Kingdom of Evenhood, and players will have to use strategic thinking to outwit their opponent. I was able to produce two sprite sheets within the time allotted and delivered a set of sound effects. (My own flatmates helped with recording some of the lines). The sprites were the units (pikemen) and the sound effects were their voicelines (and screams). My teammate put in many hours of programming in order to allow three units on the field for each team, two types of victory, combat, and a couple of menus in the game.</p>

      <p><p>In having our game’s alpha, Parity Peril, playtested by our fellow student developers, I am glad to say we had fairly positive feedback, with very understandable criticisms. Largely, the others stated that the art was working well (which I, as the artist on this project, am glad to hear). However, the completed art has yet to be implemented, and many noted the lack of sound. Most criticisms surrounded the lack of mechanics currently available in the alpha, which were due to time constraints. For example, one student dev (and original developer of the board game on which this alpha is based), stated on our Piazza forum that the mechanics could be more skill and less luck based.</p>

      <p><p>In a recent challenge to try sundry games, three notable ones were Canabalt, QWOP, and This is the Only Level. Canabalt, an Endless Runner, is a classic in its genre, and a game with which I had previous experience. QWOP from the same era, on the other hand, was an infamous Race-to-the-Finish which I had always avoided. These two games in particular, then, have their differences, but their similarities may come as a surprise.</p>

      <p><p>The prototype began as a grid-based game, where winning meant capturing all holdings (cubes) or eliminating all of the enemy’s units (“Sorry” pieces). Chaz drew the grid (then 11x8), and we set three units on either side. We placed four gray cubes on the grid in a cross formation, and four in a box formation outside of that. The action-point (AP) system was a bit complicated, but there was movement, attack rolls (wounding and retreating), bandage rolls, as well as elimination rolls. I will leave out the rules for brevity, but the core mechanic was capturing cities.</p>

      <p><p>Medhavi, Carlo, Alani, and I decided to play Betrayal at House on the Hill, a game where the board is procedurally generated and the scenario is determined later. Among the characters, I chose Professor Longfellow as he’s easily the most interesting character - a scientist and lover of Gaelic music. Carlo chose a character with red backing (probably Ox Bellows), and Medhavi chose one with blue backing (I believe Vivian Lopez). Alani chose one with purple backing (either Jenny LeClerc or Heather Granville). Then, the game began with all four of us in the starting three-space hallway.</p>
