    <p>Since my teammate and I first developed the alpha of Parity Peril as a digital game, we added some desired content and critical features. In fact, in the new instructions screen, the story is once again explained to the player. The Kingdom of Odddom has launched an assault on the Kingdom of Evenhood, and players will have to use strategic thinking to outwit their opponent. I was able to produce two sprite sheets within the time allotted and delivered a set of sound effects. (My own flatmates helped with recording some of the lines). The sprites were the units (pikemen) and the sound effects were their voicelines (and screams). My teammate put in many hours of programming in order to allow three units on the field for each team, two types of victory, combat, and a couple of menus in the game.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/iterating_on_the_alpha/PP_battle.png" alt="Splash images" />
<em>The splash images of the pikemen were replaced with sprites.</em></p>

<p>In this simplistic war game, weâ€™ve seen but two bugs: sometimes, when units are wounded, they do not show the proper sprite, and units may be able to walk into each other. Want to find some bugs of your own? Below, you can find Parity Peril for common platforms. Simply extract the executable and .pck file, and launch the executable. Instructions are accessible from the main menu, and the player will well be on their way to serving Odddom or saving Evenhood. The game could definitely continue in its iteration (with various goals stated in my previous post); However, both my teammate and I are moving on to our final projects.</p>
