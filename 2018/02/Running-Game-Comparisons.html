    <p>In a recent challenge to try sundry games, three notable ones were Canabalt, QWOP, and This is the Only Level. Canabalt, an Endless Runner, is a classic in its genre, and a game with which I had previous experience. QWOP from the same era, on the other hand, was an infamous Race-to-the-Finish which I had always avoided. These two games in particular, then, have their differences, but their similarities may come as a surprise.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/running_game_comparisons/Canabalt2.png" alt="Dud missile" />
<em>A dud missile falls in the dystopian world of Canabalt.</em></p>

<p>Formal elements may help illustrate the differences (Fullerton, 2014). Within Player Interaction Patterns, they are both Single Player Versus Game. Both of their Objectives are split betwixt chase and race, with Canabalt leaning toward chase (trying to overcome the level’s attempts to thwart the player) while QWOP is focused on race (compare speeds with others). In terms of procedures, both have very limited input (Canabalt has effectively one key, and QWOP four). These control the bodies of the player.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/running_game_comparisons/qwop15.png" alt="QWOP" />
<em>The controls of QWOP make 15 meters feel hard-earned.</em></p>

<p>Both games have no resources (no health, units, action points, etc) except one life, which when lost, resets the game. In terms of mechanics, both record a distance to measure one’s accomplishments. Besides these, the games have an entirely different theme. Canabalt follows an office worker escaping the futuristic destruction of a city, whereas QWOP simply features an athlete attempting to run 100 meters.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/running_game_comparisons/thisIsTheOnlyLevel21.png" alt="stage 21" />
<em>In “stage” 21, gravity is determined by block color.</em></p>

<p>A partner and I also switched off playing This is the Only Level. Watching and playing this game gave me two distinct experiences. While watching, I mostly wondered what the new twist would be with every play-through of the same level. I could see how another player would react, by trying keys and alternating between the high and low paths. His doing so allowed him to remember the levels much more clearly than I at that point. Definitely after I had watched it, playing it was different. I knew the mechanics/twists and could rush through the levels. Once I hit a level I had not reached, I experienced the same effect of having to play with the controls to discover the twist. Clearly this game featured an exploration aesthetic.</p>
