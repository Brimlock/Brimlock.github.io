    <p>For the final project of our game studies class, my team has put forward the idea of Bridgebound. (It is a name I thought of, but our lead has humorously, occasionally referred to it as Bridgeborne, for his love of another game series). This is a 3D, third-person game developed by our team of four in the Unreal Engine. It is single-player, designed to be a sole, engrossing boss fight, which relies on unique mechanics and gives a full-fledged experience. (We have included menus, lore, the main game loop, custom assets, win/loss conditions, and more).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/bridgebound_alpha/startScrn.png" alt="Start screen" />
<em>The start screen was partly inspired by Half-Life 2.</em></p>

<p>Mechanics have included an infinite abyss with bridges generated procedurally as the player descends. Bridges may also be destroyed by attacks from either the player of the foe. The player is a hooded, nameless bow-wielding character, which may maneuver by walking, dashing, and jumping. The enemy, however, is an angelic foe who shoots cleverly, and returning fire, let alone beating the game, is not easy!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/bridgebound_alpha/combat.png" alt="Bridges crumbles" />
<em>The bridges crumble around a fleeting player.</em></p>

<p>For future work, our story is yet putative, and we intend to determine it in our progression from the alpha to the final project. We have several areas of the game we wish to polish, but I believe the team is well on its way to presenting a finished game. Notably, we need a 3D model for the foe and a smooth transition for the win and loss conditions. (Right now, the game cuts back to the start screen). As for myself, besides working on the transition, I will implement more of the options in the menus / UI.</p>

<em>The foe currently borrows the playerâ€™s model.</em></p>
