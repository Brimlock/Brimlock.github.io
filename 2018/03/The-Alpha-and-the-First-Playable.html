    <p>In having our game’s alpha, Parity Peril, playtested by our fellow student developers, I am glad to say we had fairly positive feedback, with very understandable criticisms. Largely, the others stated that the art was working well (which I, as the artist on this project, am glad to hear). However, the completed art has yet to be implemented, and many noted the lack of sound. Most criticisms surrounded the lack of mechanics currently available in the alpha, which were due to time constraints. For example, one student dev (and original developer of the board game on which this alpha is based), stated on our Piazza forum that the mechanics could be more skill and less luck based.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/the_alpha_and_the_first_playable/gameplay.png" alt="Colored castles" />
<em>Colored castles indicated captured holdings.</em></p>

<p>For two other accounts, one student dev, J. A. stated that it was hard to tell whose turn it was. Additionally, he stated that the controls (character movement) was hard to enact. On the other hand, student dev K.D. stated that the controls were easy – if they were made known before the game began (made available on our Piazza forum). He further went on to suggest that when capturing a holding within the game, two different sounds should be played depending on if it be a neutral or enemy holding.</p>

<p>Many of the suggestions were for bugfixes or features which were originally planned. These include increased skill-based mechanics and a changed victory condition. Indeed, we are planning on adding combat and multiple player units. We’re also planning on making the victory condition based capturing a majority of the points or eliminating players, rather than just capturing all points. Two suggestions in particular will be taken immediately, including adding an indicator of whose turn it is, and adding sounds (and K. D. suggestion) to the game.</p>
